To determine the SQL Server port currently in use, you can use the following query. This query retrieves the port number from the sys.dm_exec_connections dynamic management view or by inspecting the SQL Server configuration:


Option 1: Using Dynamic Management Views
sql
SELECT local_net_address AS IPAddress, 
       local_tcp_port AS Port
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
This query gives you the IP Address and Port of the current SQL Server instance connection.

Option 2: Using Configuration Manager
If you prefer to query the SQL Server configuration, use the xp_readerrorlog stored procedure to parse the error log for the port information.

sql
EXEC xp_readerrorlog 0, 1, N'Server is listening on';
The output will include lines indicating the IP address and port, such as:

Server is listening on [ 'any' <ipv4> 1433].


Option 3: Using sys.configurations (for static configurations)
If the port is statically set in the configuration, you can retrieve it as follows:

EXEC sp_readerrorlog 0, 1, 'listening';
